As a first step for any automation script will be , launching the web browser.
* Launching web browser * :-
    -> in our project structure under src/main/java/org.issi.driver package, we have 'Driver' class, in which we have code/methods to
    intiate the browser and to close the browser.
    -> these initiate and close browser methods, we are calling in '@Before & @After' methods inn'src/test/java/org.issi.hooks/Hooks' class
        so it will get execute before and after of each scenario.

* To Login *
    -> Create login feature file, in src/test/resources/Appfeatures folder, with .feature extension, once you run this login feature file
    in consol it will display the steps that are undefined with a templet, we can use that templet to define the steps.

    -> In src/test/java/stepdefinition pack we defined 'LoginSteps' class with the steps corresponding to the login feature file.




-> As a first step , we need to create 'LoginPage' class, in src/main/java/org.issi.page pack
    -> Defined 'LoginPage' class as 'final' to restrict on doing multiple inheritance (or) Not to extend this login page class
    -> Created one 'Private' constructor to restrict on creating new object for this login page class
    -> 'identified the elements' present in login page using 'By' locator
    -> Defined 'corresponding action methods' for the elements identified.

-> Right click on 'Appfeatures' folder in src/test/resources-> New -> File -> enter new file name with '.feature' extension
